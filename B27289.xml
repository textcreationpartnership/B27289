            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>SIR <hi>Cloudsley Shovell,</hi> with seven Men of War, two Yatchs, two Sloops and a Ketch, came to <hi>Dublin</hi> last <hi>Thursday</hi> Evening, he sent most part of them to the Southward to Cruise on the <hi>Irish</hi> Coast, and entred the Bay with four Men of War, and the <hi>Monmouth</hi> Yatch of eleven Guns, in which Sir <hi>Cloudsley</hi> himself Fought, his own Ships being so big, could not come up. All the small <hi>Irish</hi> Ships stranded themselves under the Shelter of some Cannon at <hi>Rings-end.</hi> Captain <hi>Bennet</hi>'s Frigat of eighteen Guns, One hundred and fifty Tun, cut her Cables, and was stranded in <hi>Salmon Pool,</hi> where he maintained a Fight an hour and an half with the <hi>Monmouth</hi> Yatch, till <hi>Bonnet</hi> had lost seventeen of his Men, and three so wounded that they after died; and then he went off in a Boat with what Men he had left, and carried two Bags of Mony with him. There
<pb facs="tcp:200362:2"/> was found in the Ship an <hi>English-man,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and a late Convert who was mortally wounded. He was asked, <hi>What Religion he died of</hi> and he answered, <hi>That he co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">

The Ship was laden with Hides, Tallow, and Wooll, and was designed for <hi>France</hi> within two days. During the Fight King <hi>James,</hi> and many People came upon the <hi>Strand,</hi> among whom, after the Ship was taken, Sir <hi>Cloudsly</hi> bestowed some Shot, which suddenly disperst them. After this Sir <hi>Cloudsley</hi> went in his Long-boat expecting to take in some <hi>Protestants,</hi> but only two Boys, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout seventeen years of Age, pretending to gather Cockles, took that opportunity of making their Escape, who were taken on Board, and brought off. There came also two Troopers towards the Boat, who were taken to be Friends, but one of them fired his Pistol to the Boat without harm, (the other ran away) upon which Sir <hi>Cloudsley</hi> himself shot his Horse dead, and wounded him; the Troopes escaped, leaving his Boots, Saddle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> behind him, which our Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men went ashore for, and got. We had only one Man wounded in this Action. The Frigat is at <hi>Belfast</hi> with Sir <hi>Cloudsley;</hi> but the <hi>Monmouth</hi> Yatch came last <hi>Monday</hi> Night to <hi>High-Lake</hi> with this Account. One of the Men that was taken in the Ship, says, The Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> swears he will never head the <hi>Irish</hi> more, they being such Cowards And the <hi>Irish,</hi> to be even with him, tell him, Though he lost the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle at <hi>Cavan,</hi> yet he won the Race, coming first to <hi>Dublin</hi> without his Wigg. Last Night twelve Companies of <hi>Nassau</hi>'s Regiment came here; and the Night before came in above forty Wagons designed for <hi>Ireland.</hi> We have Advice from <hi>Belfast</hi> that forty great Ships from <hi>Bristol,</hi> with four Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and great store of Provisions, arrived there on <hi>Good Friday.</hi>
